","Patient Religion","HL7® Austria FHIR® Core Extension for the religion (registered in Austria) of a patient.
The extension is used to encode the religious confession of a patient (only confessions registered in Austria). Furthermore, it uses the official [HL7 AT CodeSystem](https://termpub.gesundheit.gv.at:443/TermBrowser/gui/main/main.zul?loadType=CodeSystem&loadName=HL7 AT ReligionAustria) for religion and is therefore aligned with the ELGA ValueSet, respectively.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Extension",0,*,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
